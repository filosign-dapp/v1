- Smart contract automation
- Transparent fee calculations

## User Workflows

### Getting Started
1. Connect Web3 wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
2. Register account and generate encryption keys
3. Pay 1 USDFC registration fee
4. Start uploading and sharing files

### File Sharing Process
1. Select files and specify recipients
2. Configure access permissions and expiration
3. Files encrypted client-side with AES-256
4. Upload to IPFS, store keys on Filecoin
5. Recipients receive secure download links

### Access Management
- Grant additional recipients access
- Revoke permissions anytime (unless irrevocable)
- Monitor download activity and statistics
- Make files permanently accessible

## Use Cases
